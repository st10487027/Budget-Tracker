# Meal Suggestion App

This is a small Android APP I made for my school project.
 

This app calculates total expenses from four input fields, compares them to income and shows colour based on the feedback and shows error messages.

For example:
	If if enter 4 expenses that are greater than my income, the app will show a red message saying that its a negative result.
	If the incomes is more than the expenses, then the app shows a green message as a positive result.

## How the App works
  - you type in your Income as a number
  - you type your 4 different expenses
  - press calculate button, then app will do the calculations.
